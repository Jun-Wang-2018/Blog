In previous post, we've got some general ideas about ECDSA, this post will focus on intuitions behind `secp256k1`, the set of parameters Bitcoin used. Before we dive in, let's get a glimpse of what it looks like. [Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters: page 15][v1-2].

## I. The order of a base point
### 1. Base point and it's generated group
{% katexmm %}
The example in previous post is : $a=1,b=1,P=23,x_{1}=3,y_{1}=10$. Or state in another away
$$y^2=x^3+x+1\space mod\space 23$$
We started from a initial point $G(0,1)$, sometimes called base point. By multiplying $G$ with $1,2,...,28$ respectivly, we generated a __group__ of 28 points(the last point $O$ is the point at infinity):$$ (0,1),$$.
What will happen if we starts from another base point? A very interesting property is: as long as a base point is in this __group__ of 28 points, the points generated by multiplication are still in this __group__. Figure 3.1-3.27 show 27 base points and the group generated by them respectivly. One last point does not show here is infinity point $O$.$0$,$o$,$\0$,$\mathcal{O}$

{% katexmm %}
There are 12 base points including (0,1), each of them generates the same 28 points group(27 points + $O$). There are 6 base points, each of them generates a group of 14 points. There are 6 other base points each of them genertates a group of 7 points. There are 3 base points each of them generates a group of 3 points. Point $O$ generates a group of 1 point(by definition $O+O=O$).

| Base Point | # of Generated Points | Divisor of 28? |
|:----------------------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|
| (0,1)(0,22)(1,7)(1,16)(3,10)(3,13)(9,7)(9,16)(18,3)(18,20)(19,5)(19,18) |  28 |  yes |
| (6,4)(6,19)(7,11)(7,12)(12,4)(12,19) | 14 | yes |
| (5,4)(5,19)(13,7)(13,16)(17,3)(17,20) | 7 | yes |
| (4,0)(11,3)(11,20) | 4 | yes |
| $O$ | 1 | yes |
