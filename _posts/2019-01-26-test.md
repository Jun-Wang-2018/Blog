## I. Intuition About Elliptic Curve: Basics
### 1. Double a point(Add a point to itself):
katex.render("c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}", element, {
    throwOnError: false
});
   Let's consider a elliptic curve$(EC)$: $$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$
   , `mod(p)` will be discussed latter.

   There is a initial point $G(x_{1},y_{1})$ on $EC$, how to get $D = G + G$?

   Draw a tangent line at $G$, and cross $EC$ at $C(x_{c},y_{c})$. The vertical line crosses $C$, will cross $EC$ at $D(x_{3},y_{3})$, which is the result $G+G$ by definition.
